## What is a Stream?

A stream in the RxJS world simply represents <span style="color:#EF6C00">**values over time**</span>.

example: user filling out different form fields in a form, users sending chat messages etc.

Stream is simply a concept and Observables are what facilitates a stream.

## Observables, Observers & Subscriptions

- When you subscribe to an observable, you are an observer.
- An observable can have multiple observers.

This is just basics of the relationship between observables, observers and subscriptions.
